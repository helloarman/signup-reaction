# SignupReaction

I created a signup page using JavaScript called "SignupReaction". I began by creating a prototype on Figma, and then spent 7-8 hours bringing it to life with JavaScript. The page features three different face characters, each with its own set of conditions. I hope you enjoy the final result!
